# This script manages a Docker-Compose instance.
# It takes the instance name and an optional mode for the 'down' command.
#
# Usage: $0 <instance_name> [mode]
#
# Available modes:
#   build_up (default): Only builds and brings up containers, skipping the 'down' command.
#   down-v: Executes 'docker compose down -v'.
#   fromzero: Executes 'docker compose down -v', 'docker compose build' and 'docker compose up -d'.
#   restart: Executes 'docker compose restart'.
#   stop: Executes 'docker compose stop'.
